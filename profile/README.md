# nhealth

Welcome to **nhealth** – a suite of tools designed to help you rapidly build healthcare applications with Node.js and Bun.

## 🎯 Our Mission

We focus on making healthcare application development faster, more efficient, and standards-compliant by providing modern tooling for:

- **FHIR-based applications** – Building interoperable healthcare systems using the FHIR standard
- **Medical imaging integration** – Seamlessly integrating imaging use cases into your healthcare workflows
- **Event-driven architectures** – Connecting healthcare systems through robust queuing and event systems

## 🚀 Our Projects

### [nvent](https://github.com/nhealthorg/nvent)
An event system designed for queuing and connecting healthcare systems together. nvent provides a robust foundation for building event-driven architectures in healthcare applications.

### [nfhir](https://github.com/nhealthorg/nhealth) (formerly nhealth)
A comprehensive toolkit for building FHIR-based healthcare applications. Designed to accelerate development while maintaining compliance with FHIR standards for healthcare data interoperability.

### [node-dicom-rs](https://github.com/DevJoghurt/node-dicom-rs) *(Coming Soon)*
Medical imaging integration for Node.js applications. This upcoming tool will enable seamless DICOM support for healthcare applications, bridging the gap between imaging systems and modern web technologies.
